## GAMBLING MATHEMATICS

This website which was developed by [Shwetabh](https://github.com/nIMblEt06), [Jay](https://github.com/jay-goyal) and [myself](https://github.com/bit-by-bits) acted as the official one, for the Math-based quiz in APOGEE.22 BITS PILANI.

Organised by the Math Association, quiz participants were provided questions by integrating these designs with backend-fetched randomised data, so that questions were rarely repeated and everyone got a fair chance to win. 

The tech stack used was Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS and Django for backd purposes.
