## GAMBLING MATHEMATICS

Developed with [Shwetabh](https://github.com/nIMblEt06) and [Jay](https://github.com/jay-goyal), these pages were used for the official Math-based quiz in APOGEE'22 BITS PILANI.

Organised by the Math Association, quiz participants were provided questions by integrating these designs with backend-fetched randomised data, so that questions were rarely repeated and everyone got a fair chance to win. 

The tech stack used was Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS and Django for backd purposes.
